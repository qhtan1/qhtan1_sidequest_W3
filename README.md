## Description

This project is a small interactive horror narrative built using p5.js.  
It extends the Week 3 starter code by introducing multiple game states, branching story paths, and a simple player state variable that affects narrative outcomes.

The experience unfolds across several screens (scenes), with player choices determining how the story progresses and which ending is reached.
